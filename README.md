Learning Chessboard (LCHB)
===========================

LCHB is an interactive chessboard that tracks the game, the clock, and shows the legal moves during playing. It is implemented using an Arduino Mega 2560 and custom electronics. Documentation to build your own hardware can be found in Technichal_report.pdf and else a guide to understand the algorithm used in coding can be found in Algorithm_guide.pdf. If you encounter any problem, contact us, we will be happy to help.
The code in this repository can be useful if:

  - You are building your own chess game.
  - You are implementing a matrix style electronics driver for sensors (Reed Switchs where used)
  - You need a basic representation of a chessboaed suitable for a microcontroller

Version
---------
1a

Installation
--------------
First, you should install FastLed library by using Arduino IDE's library manager. Then, open LCHB-Controller_ver-1a.ino with the Arduino IDE and burn it to the Arduino Mega.
